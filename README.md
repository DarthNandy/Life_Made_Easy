Simple python codes 
Hey folks this is a simple python code that can take a huge csv file as input and provide you only the required columns that you reqire in another csv file and a log file.
This can also insert the columns into the database you want. Now to do that create the database and update the details in the code.
I created my database in xampp.
Dont forget to update your csv files locations in the code and also dont forget to change the column names in the code those are according to my csv files.
Ive added comments in the code to help you understand the logic .
Hope its useful!
